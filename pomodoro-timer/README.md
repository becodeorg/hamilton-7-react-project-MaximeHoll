Hello!

Welcome to my Pomodoro timer app!

The purpose was to make a very simple Pomodoro timer.

You can find the link to the website here:

The timer starts at 25 min and gives you a full session of work. After it is over, it will prompt you to take a break.

You can also choose to add or remove minutes with the + and - buttons (while timer is inactive!).

You can reset time with the reset button (time will go back to 25 minutes).
