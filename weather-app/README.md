Hello and welcome to my Weather app!

The aim is to offer a very simple weather app that will provide you with average, min and max temperatures for 5 days.

The app will also load an image of the city as background if said image does exist in the API I used.

Images might take some time to load.

Here is the link to my app:

Enjoy!
